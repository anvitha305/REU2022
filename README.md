# REU2022

This is a GitHub Repository for the Mizzou 2022 Consumer Networking REU, specifically the Network Services for UAV Swarm Based Applications.

Here, we will be placing our code for our topologies and experimental setups for networks that use our framework TIGER, which is based on leveraging the aspects of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and the Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4) language. These features separate the control from the data plane, and allow the programmer greater flexibility in determining the processing of packets.

Some resources that we utilized during this process are as follows:
P4 Lang Tutorial GitHub: https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials.git
P4 Runtime Website for specifications on the P4 language: https://p4.org/p4-spec/p4runtime/main/P4Runtime-Spec.html
GitHub from the 2021 REU Group in Our Project Area: https://github.com/Durbek-Gafur/P4-VCC.git
